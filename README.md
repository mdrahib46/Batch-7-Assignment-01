# Car Class Project üöó

A Dart project showcasing the `Car` class implementation with essential functionalities.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project defines a `Car` class with properties such as brand, model, year of manufacture, and miles driven. It encapsulates methods for driving the car, retrieving details such as brand, model, year, miles driven, and calculating the car's age based on the current year.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Car Class**: Defines a robust class structure with encapsulated properties and methods.
- **Driving Simulation**: Method to simulate driving and update miles driven.
- **Information Retrieval**: Getters to retrieve detailed car information.
- **Age Calculation**: Computes the car's age dynamically based on the current year.

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Run the Dart file:
   ```bash
   dart car_project.dart
   ```

## Example Output üìù

```dart
void main() {
  // Create car instances
  Car bmw = Car(brand: 'BMW', model: 'X5', year: 2018);
  Car honda = Car(brand: 'Honda', model: 'Civic', year: 2020);

  // Simulate driving
  bmw.drive(1500.5);
  honda.drive(1200.75);

  // Display car details
  print('Brand: ${bmw.getBrand()}');
  print('Model: ${bmw.getModel()}');
  print('Year: ${bmw.getYear()}');
  print('Miles driven: ${bmw.getMilesDriven()} km');
  print('Age: ${bmw.getAge()} years');

  // Repeat for other cars...

  // Display total number of Car objects created
  print('\nTotal cars created: ${Car.numberOfCars}');
}
```
