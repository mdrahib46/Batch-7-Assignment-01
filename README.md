# Car Class Project üöó

A Dart project showcasing the `Car` class implementation with essential functionalities.

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project defines a `Car` class with properties such as brand, model, year of manufacture, and miles driven. It encapsulates methods for driving the car, retrieving details such as brand, model, year, miles driven, and calculating the car's age based on the current year.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Car Class**: Defines a robust class structure with encapsulated properties and methods.
- **Driving Simulation**: Method to simulate driving and update miles driven.
- **Information Retrieval**: Getters to retrieve detailed car information.
- **Age Calculation**: Computes the car's age dynamically based on the current year.

## Usage ‚ö°Ô∏è

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Run the Dart file:
   ```bash
   dart car_project.dart
   ```

## Example Mian Functionüõ†Ô∏è

```dart
void main(){

// Created Car 1 object//
  Car bmw = Car(brand: 'BMW', model: 'BMW X', year: 1916);
  print('Brand Name : ${bmw.getBrand()}');
  print('Model Name : ${bmw.getModel()}');
  print('${bmw.getModel()} has been manufactured on ${bmw.getYear()}');
  bmw.drive(1500.540);
  print('${bmw.getModel()} has been driven ${bmw.getMilesDriven()} kilometers');
  print('Age : ${bmw.getAge()} years');

// Created Car 2 object//
  Car hyundai = Car(brand: 'hyundai', model: 'hyundai civic', year: 1972);
  print('Brand Name : ${hyundai.getBrand()}');
  print('Model Name : ${hyundai.getModel()}');
  print('${hyundai.getModel()} has been manufactured on ${hyundai.getYear()}');
  hyundai.drive(1200.50);
  print('${hyundai.getModel()} has been driven ${hyundai.getMilesDriven()} kilometers');
  print('Age : ${hyundai.getAge()} years');

// Created Car 2 object//
  Car ferrari = Car(brand: 'Ferrari', model: 'Ferrari Roma', year: 2020);
  print('Brand Name : ${ferrari.getBrand()}');
  print('Model Name : ${ferrari.getModel()}');
  print("${ferrari.getModel()} has been manufactured on ${ferrari.year}");
  ferrari.drive(1000.75);
  print('${ferrari.getModel()} has been driven on ${ferrari.getMilesDriven()} kilometers');
  print('Age : ${ferrari.getAge()} years');



  print('\nNumber of object created : ${Car.numberOfCars}');

}
```
